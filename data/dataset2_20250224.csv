overseas,"Barbato, D; Pristeri, G; De Marchi, M",GIS-BIM Interoperability for Regeneration of Transurban Areas,urban regeneration; GIS; BIM; interoperability; urban projects,"In order to manage analysis and project processes at a territorial, urban and architectural scale, linking information to metric data is an increasingly important topic. At a geographic and cartographic stage, the function of storing, managing and viewing data and information is performed by GIS ( gis s ), where vector features as points, lines, polygons are gathered in layers connected to an attribute table. In a similar way, when scale factor increases, for buildings and other engineering works there is a growing necessity to preserve data or attributes together with the features where they belong. For this purpose, a major role is played by BIM (bim), a modelling process in which the parts of a building are hierarchically organized and every feature is connected to an information table containing all data useful for the ongoing working process or for managing the life cycle of the modelled building or infrastructure. While the two systems are similar in concept, at the moment they suffer lack of mutual communication, especially in conveying informations from a platform to another. Studying relationships and possible connections between different data storage environments like GIS and BIM is one of the research topics of DATA - Developing Abandoned Transurban Areas, a research project now in progress at University of Padova, involving Departments of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering and Industrial Engineering.

The linkage between BIM-RDF and GIS-RDF is achieved through SPARQL endpoints and defined by a query using set of datasets and entity classes with complementary properties, relationships and geometries. To validate the proposed approach and its performance, a case study was also tested using IGIM system design."

Current FDA methods, however, are ill-equipped to account for the distinctiveness of buildings in the analysis. This is mainly due to their limited input data that on the one hand requires complete building information (well-represented in building information models [BIM]) and, on the other hand, the flood information (commonly managed by  gis s  [GIS]). While such requirements cannot be satisfied via independent use of BIM or GIS, their integration can potentially be used for this purpose. The current BIM-GIS integration methods, however, are limited or application-specific. Therefore they fall short in satisfying the micro-level FDA information requirements. This paper presents a new data model as a profile of Geography Markup Language (GML) for BIM-GIS integration to support the detailed assessment and 3D visualisation of flood damage to buildings. The model was further evaluated using a case study and found effective for this purpose."

Understanding the right level of BIM to use is necessary in order to obtain an Opera constructed exactly as was it designed; and to manage the BIM process during the entire construction. This paper supports a precise thesis: the concept of measure as a way of implementing BIM.

First, a detailed geometric survey was carried out with laser scanning and photogrammetric techniques. The aim was the generation of a BIM. Displacements were then measured via geometric levelling during loading tests carried out in different days. Such data were integrated and stored in the BIM. Finally, the simulation of traffic conditions was used to investigate the usability of the BIM for a geographic area around the bridge. Results highlighted that the BIM used in the first stage of the work had to be replaced with another integrated BIM-GIS solution more suitable for analysis based on geospatial data."

For example, for the neighbourhood simulations we need simplified building geometries that can be retrieved from city models, and window information that can be extracted from BIM models (as in many cases window information is missing in city models). In this context, city models and BIM need to be integrated and reconciled. In this paper, we investigate two approaches to integrate and retrieve such information in a case study, where the BIM data is stored in IFC and the city model in CityGML (LOD2). The first approach is to perform a schema matching in an ETL tool, so as to convert and import window information from the IFC file into the CityGML model to create a LOD2-3 building model. We also investigate an alternative avenue, namely a semantic web approach, in which both the BIM and city models are transformed into knowledge graphs (linked data). City models and BIM utilize their respective but interlinked domain ontologies. Particularly, two ontologies are investigated for BIM data, i.e., the ifcOWL ontology and the building topology ontology (BOT). This paper compares different paths of such integrative data retrieval, as well as discloses the gaps mainly with the semantic web approach to further unlock its potential."

The hydrological regime of the river is characterized by high flow in winter and spring and low flow in summer. Its average slope is 0.12 % and its average bankfull width is 60 m. The coarse sediment load comes mainly from bank erosion. Although this sector is relatively less affected by past or present human activities, the propagation of morphodynamic adjustments initiated by actions carried out both upstream and downstream of this sector impacts the current functioning of the river. These erosion waves converge today towards the central part of the reserve, which led to the collapse of the central pier of the Bainville-aux-Miroirs bridge during a 2-year flood in 2011, and could induce potential risks of defluviation which may destabilize infrastructures. In this context, the study carried out aims to characterize and anticipate the morphodynamic evolutions of the Moselle to be able to propose scenarios of management and restoration of the lateral mobility of the river. For this purpose, a 2D hydro-sedimentary model is being built over the entire reserve, combined with a detailed morpho-sedimentary monitoring. In order to improve the understanding of the lateral migration of the Moselle River, a photogrammetric monitoring was carried out along the concave bank of the most active meander of the studied sector. To follow this morphological evolution more closely, it was decided to establish a 4D GIS. The objective of this monitoring is to compare the rate of bank retreat with hydrodynamic parameters in order to estimate the geotechnical properties of the bank. Comparison of the observed and modelled bank retreat must thus allow these different parameters to be calibrated in the hydro-sedimentary model.

A key application of such overlap is providing geospatial context data for BIM models through importing 3D GIS-data to BIM software to help in different design-related issues. However, this is currently difficult because of the lack of support in BIM software for the formats and data models of 3D Geo-information. This paper deals with this issue by developing and implementing a methodology to convert the common open 3D city model data model into the most common open BIM data format, namely CityGML (Groger et al., 2012) to IFC (buildingsmart, 2019b). For the aim of this study, the two standards are divided into 5 comparable subparts: Semantics, Geometry, Geographical coordinates, Topology, and Encoding. The characteristics of each of these subparts are studied and a conversion method is proposed for each of them from the former standard to the latter. This is done by performing a semantic and geometrical mapping between the two standards, converting the georeferencing from global to local, converting the encoding that the two standards use from XML to STEP, and deciding which topological relations are to be retained. A prototype implementation has been created using Python to combine the above tasks. The work presented in this paper can provide a foundation for future work in converting CityGML to IFC.

The development of digital technologies is rapid and the adoption of them significantly impacts construction projects, for example, leading to a reduction in change orders, better decision making, and improvements in quality of work. However, stakeholders may find it challenging to determine the promising technologies within the context of the AEC industry. This paper presents an exploratory study to investigate the potentially applicable technologies and their research and practice trends in the AEC industry. A scoping review was the method utilized to perform a quantitative analysis of over five thousand journals papers published from 2010 onward based on two academic databases (Scopus and CNKI). The results present the top 10 construction 4.0 technologies, including building information modelling (BIM), AI (AI), 3D printing, machine learning, internet of things (IoT),  gis s  (GIS), virtual reality (VR), big data, robotics, and augmented reality (AR). Subsequently, 145 industry professionals were invited to select the most used construction 4.0 technologies in their projects via a questionnaire survey. Mobile devices, BIM, and Digital signature are mostly adopted on-site. The findings of this study can enhance the awareness of stakeholders toward construction 4.0 technologies and may help them make better decisions in selecting and implementing the promising technologies."

The objectives aim at making a whole series of data concerning the energy efficiency and reduction at district level usable for various stakeholders, by creating a District Information Model (DIM). The described system also integrates BIM and district level 3D models with real-time data from sensors to analyse and correlate buildings utilization and provide real-time energy-related behaviours. An important role is played by the energy simulation through the EAM for matching measured and simulated data and to assess the energy performance of buildings starting from a BIM model or shared data. With this purpose interoperability tests are carried out between the BIM models and quasi-steady energy analysis tools in order to optimize the calculation of the energy demand according to the Italian technical specification UNI TS 11300. Information about the roofs slope and their orientation from the GIS model are used to predict the use of renewable energy solar thermal and PV within the selected buildings (both public and private) of the demonstrator in Turin, Italy. The expected results are a consistent reduction in both energy consumption and CO2 emissions by enabling a more efficient energy distribution policies, according to the real characteristics of district buildings as well as a more efficient utilization and maintenance of the energy distribution network, based on social behaviour and users attitudes and demand. In the future the project will allow open access with personal devices and A/R visualization of energy-related information to client applications for energy and cost-analysis, tariff planning and evaluation, failure identification and maintenance, energy information sharing in order to increase the user's awareness in the field of energy consumption.

We describe the difficulties encountered, the proposed stages to address the requirements and the results of the research conducted."

These municipalities are starting to take advantage of recent permitting technologies by migrating towards electronic permitting (e-permitting) systems. E-permitting systems have been shown to increase the efficiency of the permitting process, allowing for faster processing of permits, providing added transparency to the approval process, and streamlining document reviews and revisions. More advanced e-permitting systems are able to take advantage of latest technological advancements including building information models (BIM) and  gis s  (GIS) to enable intelligent city planning and city management capacities.

Fortunately, the most modern technological tools are helping to break down both space and time barriers. In facts, recent advances in representation, 3D modelling and survey methodologies opened new scenarios for valorization and conservation of CH. In particular, the improvement of quality in resolution and sensor sensitivity of cameras allowed to achieve the right level of 3D reconstruction through digital photogrammetry procedures. In the same field, terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) allowed acquiring dense point clouds of complex environments with a millimetric level of accuracy. At the same time, the application of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies is an excellent solution for improving the accessibility to monuments, museums and archaeological sites. It is possible to share new levels of information about CH, in space and time, for touristic, managerial and scientific aims. This work is focused on the virtualization of CH, considering the study case of the fountain of Wignacourt, today present in St. Philip Garden in Floriana and initially located in Valletta (Malta). The application presented allows the virtual fruition of the monument placed in its original location, St. George Square. A simplified plant of the square will enable tourists to make a temporal journey in the past with their mobile device.

Specifically, the creation of the virtual environment from a pre-school's indoor and outdoor environment was performed using geodetic and terrestrial laser scanning techniques. To increase the geospatial sense of pre-school children within the virtual environment, an application was developed with simple educational tasks within the 3D environment. The templates, for each section of the gaming application, have been developed using HTML5 and CSS3, in order that they are interactive and accessible to all smart devices. The paper concludes with a discussion on the experience gained towards supporting spatial thinking for pre-school children."

It can also facilitate modern applications such as robotics and virtual reality. Extensive studies have been performed on point data management and querying, but most of them concentrate on low dimensional spaces. High dimensional data management solutions from computer science have not considered the special features of spatial data; so, they may not be optimal. A Space Filling Curve (SFC) based approach, PlainSFC which is capable of nD point querying has been proposed and tested in low dimensional spaces. However, its efficiency in nD space is still unknown. Besides that, PlainSFC performs poorly on skewed data querying. This paper develops HistSFC which utilizes point distribution information to improve the querying efficiency on skewed data. Then, the paper presents statistical analysis of how PlainSFC and HistSFC perform when dimensionality increases. By experimenting on simulated nD data and real data, we confirmed the patterns deduced: for inhomogeneous data querying, the false positive rate (FPR) of PlainSFC increases drastically as dimensionality goes up.

Twenty years of experience in delivering digital engineering-geological mapping in 1: 10 000 scale and archival geotechnical reports acquisition and digitisation allowed gathering of more than 300 thousands engineering-geological boreholes database as well as set of 10 thematic spatial layers (including foundation conditions map, depth to the first groundwater level, bedrock level, geohazards). Historically, the desktop approach was the source form of the geological-engineering data storage, resulting in multiple non-correlated interbase datasets. The need for creation of domain data model emerged and an object-oriented modelling (UML) scheme has been developed. The aim of the aforementioned development was to merge all datasets in one centralised Oracle server and prepare the unified spatial data structure for efficient web presentation and applications development. The presented approach will be the milestone toward creation of the Polish national standard for engineering-geological information management. The paper presents the approach and methodology of data unification, thematic vocabularies harmonisation, assumptions and results of data modelling as well as process of the integration of domain model with enterprise architecture implemented in PGS. Currently, there is no geological data standard in Poland. Lack of guidelines for borehole and spatial data management results in an increasing data dispersion as well as in growing barrier for multilevel data management and implementation of efficient decision support tools. Building the national geological data standard makes geotechnical information accessible to multiple institutions, universities, administration and research organisations and gather their data in the same, unified digital form according to the presented data model. Such approach is compliant with current digital trends and the idea of Spatial Data Infrastructure. Efficient geological data management is essential to support the sustainable development and the economic growth, as they allow implementation of geological information to assist the idea of Smart Cites, deliver information for Building Information Management (BIM) and support modern spatial planning. The engineering-geological domain data model presented in the paper is a scalable solution. Future implementation of developed procedures on other domains of PGS geological data is possible."

It is helpful to simulate the airflow and temperature to optimize the workload distribution. Traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is usually time-consuming while conventional reduced order models (ROMs), though computationally fast, may generate inaccurate results even after being fully trained. In Situ Adaptive Tabulation (ISAT), contracting to conventional ROM, can make prediction with error lower than a user-specified tolerance. To demonstrate using of ISAT for optimal workload distribution in data center, this paper presents a preliminary study of an ISAT-based genetic algorithm optimization platform. The ISAT is trained offline by using the results from CFD simulations using a hypothetical simple data center. The optimal workload distribution determined by the platform leads to approximately 6.8% of energy savings when compared to the benchmark with a uniform workload distribution.

By charging and discharging energy storage, energy flexibility can be created and heat demand and heat generation can be matched in time. One possible source of energy flexibility is the thermal capacity of the water in district heating network pipes. Effective use of this thermal energy storage requires efficient techniques to determine the available flexibility. The goal of this paper is to determine the required lod of a substation model to characterise network flexibility through simulation. The substation models differ in the assumptions that are made and range from a detailed, non-linear model to a simple, linear model. To analyse the results, we identify different phases occurring during a network flexibility activation.

They are defined at different levels (international, national, regional), by various organizations and standards, incorporate numerous aspects (natural and built environment, infrastructures and open spaces, social, economic, and cultural processes, tangible and intangible heritage) and face various challenges (urbanization, globalization, mass tourism, climate change, etc.). However, their current specification within large-scale geospatial databases is similar to those of urban areas in a broad sense resulting in the loss of many aspects forming this multifaceted concept. The present study considers the available ontologies and data models, coming from various domains and having different granularities and levels of detail, to represent historical small urban centres information. The aim is to define the needs for extension and integration of them in order to develop a multidisciplinary, integrated semantic representation. Relevant conventions and other legislation documents, ontologies and standards for cultural heritage (CIDOC-CRM, CRMgeo, Getty Vocabularies), 3D city models (CityGML), building information models (IFC) and regional landscape plans are analysed to identify concepts, relations, and semantic features that could form a holistic semantic model of historical small urban centres."

In our paper we address the problem of supporting different types of locomotion in indoor navigation by the examination of the requirements of the three types of locomotion walking, driving, and flying.

These constraints are essential in the determination of navigable or nonnavigable indoor space cells for the specific locomotion type, leading effectively to different 3D subspacings of indoor space.

The grey Verhulst model (GVM) has demonstrated well performance on saturation curve, such as displacement of deep excavation. This paper establishes the GVMm by improving GVM to predict the displacement more precisely. BIM-3 gis  framework is also built by integrating BIM and 3 gis  in the application level for the efficiency of system operation and the interaction with the risk management platform. BIM-3 gis  framework, working with the risk management platform, can monitor the risk variation of deep excavation effectively and provide visual decision-making supports. A real case of deep excavation is used as an illustrative example to verify the practicability. The results show that the prediction precision of GVMm is better than that of GVM. The application scenarios also demonstrate the effectiveness of the risk management system.","A Risk Management System for Deep Excavation Based on BIM-3 gis  Framework and Optimized Grey Verhulst Model Risk management of deep excavation is always an important issue.
